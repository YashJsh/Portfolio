            I’m a software developer focused on building clean, reliable systems.
            I enjoy working close to fundamentals — backend logic, real-time
            communication, and understanding how things work under the hood.
          </p>
          <p className="mx-w-2xl leading-relaxed text-foreground/80">
          I spent my time building backend systems, real-time features, and full-stack projects, and I care deeply about structure, clarity, and long-term maintainability.
